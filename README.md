# SecuroSphere

SecuroSphere is a web security platform designed to protect applications with multiple layers of security. It uses features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Captcha to keep user accounts safe, while OAuth and JWT-based authentication allow secure access without constantly needing passwords. With AI-driven monitoring, SecuroSphere can detect and stop suspicious activities, keeping applications and data safe from threats.

The platform is flexible and helps organizations manage teams and users more effectively. Companies can create teams and sub-teams with their own names, logos, and permissions to control who can access what. SecuroSphere also provides easy-to-use APIs, so developers can quickly add strong security features to their systems without extra effort.

Built with reliable tools like Spring Boot, MongoDB, and React, SecuroSphere is fast, scalable, and easy to use. It offers clear dashboards and detailed insights, making it a great choice for businesses of any size. Whether youâ€™re securing a company portal or a customer app, SecuroSphere makes it simple to keep everything protected.
