                If any provision of these Terms of Use are held unlawful, void,
                or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision is deemed
                severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the

                instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such

                performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will in no

                Use is not construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of
